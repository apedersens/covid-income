# covid-income
The aim of this project was to investigate the relationship between Per Capita Income in 2020 and COVID-19 Death Rates during the same year. To achieve this goal, I combined COVID-19 and Per Capita Income data from various counties across the United States and analyzed the combined data using Python and machine learning techniques.
