# covid-income
The aim of this project was to investigate the relationship between per capita income and COVID-19 death rates during 2020. To achieve this goal, I combined COVID-19 and Per Capita Income data from various counties across the United States and analyzed the combined data using Python and machine learning techniques. To view the data preparation and analyzation processes, please see the Covid-income.ipynb notebook. To view a summary of the main findings from this project, see the Data Findings pdf.
