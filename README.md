# covid-income
The aim of this project was to investigate the relationship between Per Capita Income in 2020 and COVID-19 Death Rates during the same year. To achieve this goal, I combined COVID-19 and Per Capita Income data from various counties across the United States and analyzed the combined data using Python and machine learning techniques. To view the data preparation and analyzation processes, please see the .ipynb notebook labeled Covid-income. To view a summary of the main findings from this project, see the Key Findings pdf.
